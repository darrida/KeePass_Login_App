# KeePass-Login-read-ini

[x] - Get script to successfully read from an ini file for all variables, so that (1) instance specific configuration can be modularized from the main script, and (2) a wizard can be created for guided first-time setup.

Next Task:
[ ] - Find Encrypt file in Sync, or perhaps files in NAS.
[ ] - Use Encrypt file in setup process. It will need to be able to write to the ini config file. Ideally it will be able to amend as well.

Next Task:
[ ] - Setup a config ini file for Decrypt file - store in same directory as Decrypt?
